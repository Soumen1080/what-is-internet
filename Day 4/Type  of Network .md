# Type of network ?

The term "network" most commonly refers to a computer network, which is a collection of interconnected computers and devices that can exchange data and share resources. These networks are primarily categorized by their geographical scale and their architecture.

**Categorizing Networks By Geographical Scale üó∫Ô∏è**

This is the most common way to classify networks, based on the physical area they cover.

*PAN (Personal Area Network):* 
The smallest type of network, designed for one person. It connects devices within a few meters, like a smartphone, wireless headphones, and a smartwatch using Bluetooth.

*LAN (Local Area Network):*
A network confined to a small area, such as a single building, office, or home. It's used to connect personal computers and share resources like printers or a single internet connection. Wi-Fi and Ethernet are the most common LAN technologies.

*MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):*
 Larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, a MAN typically spans a city or a large university campus. It might connect several LANs from different company branches within a city.

*WAN (Wide Area Network):* 
The largest type of network, spanning a vast geographical area, such as a country or even the entire globe. A WAN connects multiple LANs and MANs. The most famous example of a WAN is the Internet.

 *Controller Area Network (CAN bus):*
This is the most common and technically specific meaning of "CAN." A Controller Area Network, universally known as the CAN bus, is a robust standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other's applications without a host computer.
