## The Internet: A Global Network

The internet is a massive, global network connecting billions of computers and other electronic devices. Think of it as a worldwide system of interconnected roads; just as roads allow cars to travel between cities, the internet allows information to travel between computers. This infrastructure lets you share information, communicate with anyone else in the world, and access a vast range of services.

# How It Works ?


At its core, the internet works by breaking down data into small pieces called packets. When you send an email or visit a website, the information is chopped up into these packets, each tagged with its destination.


These packets travel across the network through a chain of specialized computers called routers, which act like traffic controllers, directing the packets along the best path to their destination. Once all the packets arrive, the receiving computer reassembles them into the original file, webpage, or email. This entire process happens in a fraction of a secon

This system is governed by a set of rules called protocols, with the most important being the Internet Protocol (IP) and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Every device connected to the internet has a unique IP address, which acts like a mailing address, ensuring data gets to the right place.

*IP (Internet Protocol)* â€“ The Address ðŸ“¬
The Internet Protocol's only job is to provide addresses and route data packets from their source to their destination. Think of it as putting a letter in the mail. You write the recipient's address on the envelope, and the postal service uses that address to guide it to the right place.
